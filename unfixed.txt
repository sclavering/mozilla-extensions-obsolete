Bugzilla Bug 102992
	  	Link Toolbar should be converted to XBL
(we might well do this, because it would let us add a linkbar to the customisation palette v. easily)

Bugzilla Bug 103204
	  	link toolbar does not work with frames
(do we care?)

Bugzilla Bug 134436
	  	Language attributes with country codes not recognized when building link toolbar
(i.e.  hreflang=en works fine, but hreflang=en-GB might not be recognised as english.  haven't actually tested this)

Bugzilla Bug 102907
	  	Link toolbar doesn't support HTTP links headers
(we have an idea how to implement this)

Bugzilla Bug 102909
	  	No keyboard access to link toolbar
(probably going to add ctrl+< and ctrl+> (ctrl+, and ctrl+. technically))

Bugzilla Bug 105109
	  	Better handling of unrecognized link types
(probably going to do pretty much what is suggested in the bug.  our code to support multiple prev/next/etc links will come in handy)

Bugzilla Bug 109467
	  	Proposed tweaks to Link Toolbar's rel->button mapping

Bugzilla Bug 103436
	  	`Top' in Links Bar needs a better name
(considering calling it "Home" and reinstating the mapping for rel=home.  while non standard this *is* a useful feature, and authors *are* using it.  and that's what opera does)

Bugzilla Bug 103474
	  	Menus in Links Bar don't work with a single drag
(hopefully not too hard to fix.  could listen for onmouseup events?)

Bugzilla Bug 130807
	  	Site navigation bar: The optional target attribute in link tag is disregarded
(no frame support at all, but frames suck anyway)

Bugzilla Bug 154193
	  	RFE - Site navigation bar should be visible in full-screen mode
(if we make the link toolbar an item in the toolbar customisation window then the user could make this happen (by adding it to the nav toolbar))

Bugzilla Bug 195400
	  	site navigation bar remembers links from previously loaded documents
(probably fixed, but not yet tested)

Bugzilla Bug 109307
	  	Link bar not dynamically updated
(this refers to updating for *removal* of links only, which doesn't have any good use cases that I can think of)

Bugzilla Bug 109467
	  	Proposed tweaks to Link Toolbar's rel->button mapping

Bugzilla Bug 103428
	  	SiteNavBar on autoshow should stay visible if any current tab has links
(this would only be worth fixing as long as our linkbar makes the status bar taller when visible, ehich is a bug in itself, and one we plan to address)

Bugzilla Bug 205455
	  	Empty site navigation bar is show until page is loaded
(not actually a bug in moz.  it's to avoid having the bar disappear on page unload only to reappear as soon as a link is added)
