Bugzilla Bug 201979
	  	Questionable interpretation of <LINK REL="START" ... > in xpfe/browser/resources/content/linkToolbarHandler.js
(rel=start now the same as rel=first, not rel=top)

Bugzilla Bug 102906
	  	Link toolbar doesn't support <meta> links
(this is fixed, but mainly as a test for the Link header parser.  it's slow, and support may be dropped in the future)

Bugzilla Bug 198413
	  	Site navigation bar - case insensitive menus and Problem eith spaces
(trivial fix)

Bugzilla Bug 102912
	  	E-mail links in link toolbar/bookmarks are not marked
(we use a different icon for them.  also we have tooltips for all links, so it's obvious they're email addresses.  currently I think "mailto:" remains part of the tooltip, which should be changed)

Bugzilla Bug 103571
	  	toolbar separators in link toolbar don't render properly
(they render as gaps with our statusbar panel, which is what looks right)

Bugzilla Bug 102897
	  	Gap at the bottom of the link toolbar "More" menu
(hiding stuff instead of disabling meant we had to remove the separators, so this got fixed by that)

Bugzilla Bug 123188
	  	JS error in linkToolbarHandler.js
(js has been rewritten twice, maybe three times, and has no errors)

Bugzilla Bug 102915
	  	Multiple "next" links are not shown on link toolbar
(we make the buttons change to menu-buttons, indicated by a change in icon rather than adding a dropmarker)

Bugzilla Bug 128372
	  	link rev should attach to toolbar button with opposite meaning - rev="previous" <=> rel="next" etc
(done.)

Bugzilla Bug 103459
	  	`Document' and `Other' menus in Links Bar don't make sense
(they were confusing, so we just amalgamated them.  the combined menu could maybe use some reording)

Bugzilla Bug 103470
	  	Links Bar menu(s) should not contain any disabled items
(we hide them instead. much nicer)

Bugzilla Bug 127588
	  	Add URL to Site Nav Toolbar tooltips
(done.  we have 2-line tooltips, with the url always as the second line. first line is hidden if there is nothing interesting to show in it)

Bugzilla Bug 112560
	  	title attribute on link rev=author should appear on web site icon bar as tooltip
(we have tooltips on all links.  bug description is confusing though)

Bugzilla Bug 117955
	  	Greyed link toolbar icons have a shadow
(images altered to remove them)

Bugzilla Bug 133255
	  	bad interaction between site navigation bar & fixed position tables
(our bar lives in the status bar, so this does not happen)

Bugzilla Bug 152845
	  	site navigation bar: ctrl+click, middle-click should open new window/tab
(all ctrl, shift and middle click combinations implemented, and they check the user prefs.  we do however make open-in-foreground-tab the default regardless of the user pref for middle clicking of document links, because it seems much more natural)

Bugzilla Bug 161573
	  	Site Navigation Bar creates plugin overspill (Mac only)
(our bar lives in the status bar, so this does not happen)

Bugzilla Bug 141269
	  	Site Navigation Bar Menu Option checkbar doesn't update
(possibly fixed in moz too)

Bugzilla Bug 103417
	  	`View' > `Show/Hide' submenu must not have subsubmenus
(we jsut add another menu below Toolbars (the Firebird equiv. of Show/Hide)
